A HTML-Canvas-Game
A small fighting game that was created on html canvas, still some things i would like to add but the fundamentals are done

This game uses html and javascript to be able to make it work
It has two characters so far and both of their animations and sprites have been uploaded.
It is rough around the edges but there is some things I would like to add to fix some of the issues
